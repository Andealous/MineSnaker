                    The goal of minesweeper is to find all the mines in the minefield.<br><br>

                    You start the game with a 16x16 grid of squares, this is the minefield.<br>
                    There are 40 mines randomly distributed in the minefield.<br><br>

                    If you click one of the squares you will start at a mine-free zone.<br>
                    And you will see that the squares on the edges of that zone will have numbers on them.<br>
                    These numbers tell you how many mines are ajacent to it.<br>
                    So if it says 3, that means there are 3 mines around it.<br><br>

                    If you think a cell is free you can clear it by clicking it.<br>
                    This will reveal a number on the cell you cleared.<br>
                    This number again is how many mines are around that cell.<br><br>

                    If you are sure a cell contains a mine you can place a flag on it.<br>
                    Placing a flag is done by clicking the "flag" button on the bottom of the screen and then clicking the cell you want to mark.<br><br>

                    But if you clear a cell with a mine instead of marking it, the mine will explode.<br>
                    So try to think before clicking a cell.<br><br>

                    When you marked all the mines with a flag*, YOU WIN!<br><br>

                    * only the bombs, if the total flags are above 40 you still have to deselect the ones that aren't bombs
